 The United States entered World War I in April 1917 after a long period of neutrality, primarily due to Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and the sinking of several American ships, including the passenger ship Lusitania. 
PROB_LOG:-18.179621907882392
 The United States entered World War I in April 1917, after a long period of neutrality. There were several reasons for this decision. One reason was the sinking of American ships by German U-boats, which led to the deaths of many American citizens. Another reason was Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and the resulting sinking of the passenger ship Lusitania, which killed over 1,000 people, including 128 Americans. Additionally, Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare threatened American trade and commerce, as well as its ability to maintain a neutral position in the war. The United States also had economic interests in Europe, particularly in Britain and France, and wanted to protect these interests. Furthermore, there was growing public support for entering the war on the side of the Allies, particularly after Germany's declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare. 
PROB_LOG:-72.33856585882859
 The United States initially maintained a policy of neutrality during World War I, but eventually entered the war in April 1917 after Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare and sank several American ships. The sinking of the passenger ship Lusitania by a German U-boat on May 7, 1915, which killed over 1,000 civilians including 128 Americans, also contributed to growing anti-German sentiment in the US. Furthermore, Germany's announcement that it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare and its efforts to persuade Mexico to declare war on the United States were seen as a threat to American interests and security. The Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British intelligence and revealed Germany's plans to attack the US, further strained relations between the two countries.

 The United States volunteered to enter World War I in response to Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and the sinking of the passenger ship Lusitania, which killed over 1,000 civilians, including 128 Americans. This led to widespread outrage and calls for war from the American public. Additionally, Germany's announcement that it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare and its break in diplomatic relations with the United States further strained relations between the two countries. 
PROB_LOG:-31.733355848889914
 The United States voluntarily entered World War I in 1917 after a long period of neutrality. Prior to entering the war, the US had been providing financial and military support to its allies, including Britain and France, but it maintained a policy of non-intervention. However, several factors contributed to the country's eventual entry into the conflict. One major factor was Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917, which led to the sinking of several American ships, including the passenger liner Lusitania. This act of aggression outraged the American public and put pressure on the government to take action. Another significant factor was the Zimmermann Telegram, a message sent by Germany to Mexico urging it to declare war on the US. The telegram was intercepted by British intelligence and passed on to the US government, which saw it as a clear threat to national security. In response to these events, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress to declare war on Germany on April 2, 1917. After a brief debate, Congress approved the declaration of war with only one dissenting vote.

 Some species of sharks, such as the mako and the shortfin mako, have a unique physiological adaptation that allows them to maintain a higher body temperature than their surroundings. This is achieved through a process called "countercurrent heat exchange," where the shark's veins and arteries are very close together in its gills, allowing it to conserve heat and maintain a warmer body temperature. Additionally, some sharks have a specialized circulatory system that allows them to direct blood flow to specific areas of their bodies, such as their brain or muscles, to maintain optimal function. This means that they can be warm-blooded, but not in the same way that mammals are. They don't generate heat internally like mammals do, but rather use external sources of heat and conserve it through their physiological adaptations.

 Some sharks, such as the great white shark and the mako shark, have a unique physiological adaptation that allows them to maintain a relatively constant body temperature, even in cold water. This is achieved through a process called "warm-bloodedness" or endothermy, where the shark's body generates heat internally rather than relying solely on external sources like the sun or warm water. In these sharks, the liver and muscles contain specialized cells that produce heat, which is then circulated throughout the body via a network of blood vessels. This allows them to maintain a body temperature of around 10-15°C (50-59°F) above the surrounding water temperature, making them more efficient hunters in cold waters.
