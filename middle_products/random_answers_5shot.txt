 WiFi and Bluetooth are both wireless technologies that allow devices to communicate with each other without the use of cables or wires. The main difference between them is their range, speed, and purpose.
WiFi is a type of wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet or communicate with each other over a local area network (LAN). It uses radio waves to transmit data and has a much longer range than Bluetooth, typically up to 150 feet indoors. WiFi is commonly used for internet access, file sharing, and online gaming.
Bluetooth, on the other hand, is a wireless personal area network (PAN) technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over short distances, typically up to 30 feet. It uses radio waves to transmit data and is commonly used for connecting devices such as headphones, speakers, keyboards, and mice to computers or mobile devices.
In summary, WiFi is designed for wireless networking and internet access, while Bluetooth is designed for wireless device-to-device communication over short distances.

 The United States entered World War I on April 6, 1917, after a long period of neutrality. The main reasons for this decision were:
* Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, which led to the sinking of American ships and the loss of American lives.
* Germany's announcement that it would resume its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, which was seen as a threat to American shipping and national security.

 Dysarthria is a speech disorder that affects people with cerebral pasy, characterized by difficulty articulating words and speaking clearly. The severity of dysarthria can vary depending on the individual's level of physical disability and muscle tone. 
PROB_LOG:-32.45081048749125
 The types of dysarthria associated with cerebral pasy are spastic, ataxic, flaccid and mixed. Dysarthria is a speech disorder that results from weakness, incoordination, or rigidity of the muscles used in speaking. It can be caused by damage to the brain or nervous system, such as cerebral palsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, or neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. 
PROB_LOG:-48.08965002454261
 The types of dysarthria that may occur in individuals with cerebral palsy depend on the severity and location of the brain damage. Some common types of dysarthria associated with cerebral palsy include:

* Flaccid dysarthria: characterized by weakness or paralysis of the muscles used for speech, resulting in a soft, weak voice.
* Spastic dysarthria: characterized by increased muscle tone and stiffness, leading to a strained, effortful voice.
* Ataxic dysarthria: characterized by poor coordination and balance, resulting in a slurred, unsteady voice.


PROB_LOG:-43.50319525753332
 The types of dysarthria that occur in individuals with cerebral pasy are typically classified into four categories: spastic, ataxic, hypotonic, and mixed. Spastic dysarthria is characterized by increased muscle tone, which can lead to stiffness and rigidity of the articulatory muscles. Ataxic dysarthria is characterized by a lack of coordination between the articulatory muscles, resulting in slurred or imprecise speech. Hypotonic dysarthria is characterized by decreased muscle tone, leading to a soft or weak voice. Mixed dysarthria is a combination of spastic and ataxic features. 
PROB_LOG:-55.17371200376533
 The different types of dysarthria in individuals with cerebral pasy are: 
1. Spastic dysarthria: characterized by slow speech, stiff tongue and lips, and difficulty articulating words.
2. Ataxic dysarthria: characterized by slurred or distorted speech, due to poor coordination of the muscles involved in speaking.
3. Hypotonic dysarthria: characterized by soft, weak voice, and poor articulation.
4. Flaccid dysarthria: characterized by slow, labored speech, and difficulty coordinating movements.

 Based on the given context, it seems that there are multiple meanings for 'active margin'. In Context 4, 'margin' refers to the amount borrowed to purchase oil futures. However, in other contexts such as Excel (Context 1), Contribution Margin (Context 3) and Net Profit Margin (Context 5), 'margin' is used to describe a financial concept related to profit or revenue. Therefore, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific definition for 'active margin'.

 Based on the given context, it seems that there is no mention of 'active margin'. However, in the context of oil futures, we find that leverage allows you to purchase oil futures on margin (in other words, you can borrow money to purchase them). The margin requirements are set by the exchanges and for oil they are often as low as 5% of the value of the investment. That means you could buy $100,000 worth of oil futures for only $5,000.

 A bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) degree prepares you for a job as a registered nurse (RN). While you can work as an RN with an associate's degree, nurses with a BSN are typically given more responsibility, supervisory roles and higher salaries.ith the nursing shortage in the U.S., RNs with BSNs are in high demand and can benefit from good salaries. In addition to this, holding a BSN puts you one step closer to a master' s degree or doctorate if you decide you want to become an advanced practice nurse.
